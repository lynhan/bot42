=====

Existential twitter bot @glassofwhy, answering the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.

Bot42 uses the Twit API: https://github.com/ttezel/twit and is hosted on Heroku.

The account is suspended right now because the bot was replying to too many people who mentioned the "meaning of life". :p
